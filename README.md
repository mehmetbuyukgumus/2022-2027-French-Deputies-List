# Introduction
This is a data scraping exercise. In the coming days, with the inclusion of the Pandas library, the analysis of the excavated data will be added to the repository. The data subject to the study was scraped from the "https://www.assemblee-nationale.fr" site.

# Explanation
The data in the study includes the information of the deputies elected according to the results of the Presidential elections held in France in June 2022. All data is scraped from public sources and there is no personal data breach. The codes in this repository include the list of deputies who will serve between 2022 and 2027, their electoral districts, e-mail addresses, and telephone numbers.
